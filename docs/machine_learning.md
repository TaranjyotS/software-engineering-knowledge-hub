# 1. Machine Learning Fundamentals – Q&A

## Q1. What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI enabling systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions/decisions without being explicitly programmed. ML models improve performance as more data becomes available.

ML solves tasks like:
- Classification (spam / not spam)
- Regression (price prediction)
- Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Recommendation (Netflix, Amazon)
- NLP tasks (sentiment, QA)
- Vision tasks (object detection)

## Q2. Types of Machine Learning

### **1. Supervised Learning**

Model learns from labeled data (X → y).  
Algorithms:
- Linear/Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Random Forest, XGBoost
- Neural Networks

Tasks:
- Regression
- Classification

### **2. Unsupervised Learning**

No labels; model finds patterns.  
Algorithms:
- K-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering
- PCA / Dimensionality Reduction

Tasks:
- Clustering
- Anomaly detection

### **3. Reinforcement Learning**

Agents learn by interacting with environment and receiving rewards.

Applications:
- Robotics
- Game AI
- Autonomous driving

## Q3. What is Overfitting vs Underfitting?

* **Overfitting** → Model memorizes training data; poor generalization.  
  Fixes:
* Regularization
* Dropout
* More data
* Cross-validation
* **Underfitting** → Model too simple; fails to learn patterns.  
  Fixes:
* More complex models
* Feature engineering

# 2. Machine Learning Pipeline

A pipeline is a structured workflow from data ingestion to model deployment.

## **Pipeline Stages**

1. **Data Collection** – databases, APIs, logs, sensors
2. **Data Cleaning** – handling missing data, outliers, duplicates
3. **Data Preprocessing** – encoding, scaling, normalization
4. **Feature Engineering** – feature selection, creation, dimensionality reduction
5. **Model Selection** – comparing algorithms
6. **Model Training** – optimization, hyperparameters
7. **Model Evaluation** – metrics, validation
8. **Model Deployment** – serving via APIs
9. **Monitoring** – drift, performance metrics

# 3. Machine Learning Lifecycle (GfG)

The lifecycle extends beyond training to full production management.

## Stages:

1. **Problem Definition**
2. **Data Gathering**
3. **Data Preparation**
4. **Model Building**
5. **Evaluation**
6. **Deployment**
7. **Monitoring & Maintenance**
8. **Feedback Loop**

# 4. MLOps Principles

MLOps brings DevOps to ML and includes:

### Key Principles:

* **Versioning** (data, code, models)
* **Reproducibility** (pipelines)
* **Automation** (CI/CD)
* **Testing** (unit tests, integration tests, ML tests)
* **Continuous Training (CT)**
* **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
* **Monitoring** (model drift, data drift)
* **Scalability** (cloud, containers)

# 5. Code Examples (Classic ML + Deep Learning)

## Example 1 – Classic ML (scikit‑learn)

```python
from sklearn.model\_selection import train\_test\_split
from sklearn.linear\_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy\_score
from sklearn.datasets import load\_breast\_cancer

data = load\_breast\_cancer()
X, y = data.data, data.target

X\_train, X\_test, y\_train, y\_test = train\_test\_split(X, y, test\_size=0.2)

model = LogisticRegression(max\_iter=1000)
model.fit(X\_train, y\_train)

preds = model.predict(X\_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy\_score(y\_test, preds))
```

---

## Example 2 – Deep Learning (TensorFlow)

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary\_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# model.fit(X\_train, y\_train, epochs=10, batch\_size=32)

```

---

## Example 3 – Deep Learning (PyTorch)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class Net(nn.Module):
def **init**(self):
super().**init**()
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(30, 64)
self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 1)

```
def forward(self, x):
    x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
    return torch.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
```

model = Net()
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Output: model(torch.tensor(X\_train).float())

```

# 6. ML Interview Questions

## **General ML Questions**

### Q1. What is the bias-variance tradeoff?

* **Bias** = error from overly-simplistic assumptions
* **Variance** = sensitivity to fluctuations in training data  
  Goal: balance both using regularization, cross-validation.

### Q2. What is regularization?

Technique to reduce overfitting by adding penalty to loss:
- L1 = Lasso  
- L2 = Ridge

### Q3. What is the difference between bagging and boosting?

| Bagging | Boosting |
|--------|----------|
| Parallel | Sequential |
| Reduces variance | Reduces bias |
| Random Forest | AdaBoost, XGBoost |

### Q3. What is dropout?

### Q2. What is a model registry?

A central place to store model versions, metadata, approval status (MLflow, SageMaker).

### Q3. Why do we need CI/CD in ML?

To automate:
- data validation
